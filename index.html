  <h1>openpatata</h1>
  <p>[tentative] <i>openpatata</i> is an informal Cypriot initiative with a focus on
    improving civic access to publicly- and privately-held information.
    We hold that every person should have unencumbered and equal access to the
    information that shape their life and their community, free of antipopular
    bias. <i>openpatata</i> sprang in August 2015 of a desire to shed light on
    the business of the Cypriot parliamentâ€”what would've been a daunting task
    for the uninitiated. The original <i>openpatata</i>
    was a parliament monitor in the likeness of openparliament.ca and
    TheyVoteForYou (Australia). It has since evolved into an umbrella
    project for all the work we've conducted on open data.</p>
