  <h1>cynaxis</h1>
  <section id="intro">
    <p><i>cynaxis</i> is an informal Cypriot initiative with a focus on
      improving civic access to publicly- and privately-held information.
      We hold that every person should have unencumbered and equal access to the
      information that shapes their life and their community, free of antipopular
      bias. <i>cynaxis</i> has its roots in <i>openpatata</i>.
      <i>openpatata</i> sprang in August 2015 of a desire to shed light on
      the business of the Cypriot parliamentâ€”what would've been a daunting task
      for the uninitiated. <i>openpatata</i> was a parliament monitor in the
      likeness of openparliament.ca and TheyVoteForYou (Australia). It preceded
      <i>neavouli</i>, a crowdsourced candidate database, and continuing
      inquiry into open data in Cyprus. For more on what we've accomplished
      so far, see below.</p>
